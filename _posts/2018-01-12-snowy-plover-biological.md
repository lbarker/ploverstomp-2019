Legal Status: Threatened

The Pacific coast population of the western snowy plover was listed as threatened on March 5, 1993. Federal Register 58 FR 12864.

Designation as a threatened includes: Any species which is likely to become an endangered species within the foreseeable future throughout all or a significant portion of its range.

Population Decline

Records indicating that nesting western snowy plovers were historically more widely distributed in coastal California, Oregon, and Washington are unsubstantiated.

Humans caused population decline

It is claimed that human activities, such as walking, jogging, running pets, horseback riding, and vehicle use, are responsible for the ongoing decline in snowy plover breeding sites and populations. Many scientific studies concerning the impacts of humans on snowy plovers are contradictory. The west coast nesting season, from March through September, coincides with the most popular times of human beach use (Memorial Day through Labor Day).
