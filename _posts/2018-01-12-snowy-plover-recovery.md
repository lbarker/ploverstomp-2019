Highlights of the Snowy Plover Recovery Plan

The western snowy plover recovery plan provides a strategy for recovery of the population. Recovery objectives in the recovery plan include: (1) achieving well-distributed increases in numbers and productivity of breeding adult birds, and (2) providing for long-term protection of breeding and wintering plovers and their habitat.

The recovery plan states that delisting will be considered when the following criteria have been met:

maintain for 10 years an average of 3,000 breeding adults
maintain a 5-year average productivity of at least 1.0 fledged chick per male in each recovery unit in the last 5 years prior to delisting; and
have in place participation plans among cooperating agencies, landowners, and conservation organizations to ensure protection and management of breeding, wintering, and migration areas
DATE OF RECOVERY: Delisting could occur by 2047 if the recovery criteria above have been met.
