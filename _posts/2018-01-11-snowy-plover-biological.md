The western snowy plover is a small shorebird, about 6 inches long, with a thin dark bill, pale brown to gray upper parts, white or buff colored belly, and darker patches on its shoulders and head, white forehead and eyebrow line. Snowy plovers also have black patches above their white forehead and behind the eye. plover

Their dark gray to black legs are a useful characteristic when comparing them to other plover species. Plovers forage for small invertebrates in wet and dry sand, in beach kelp, and within low dune vegetation along the beach. Most sandy beaches  along the coasts of California, Oregon, and Washington  are considered snowy plover breeding and wintering areas. Most publicly owned sandy  beaches are also considered breeding and wintering areas. These areas are subject to the Recovery Plan beaches in Southern California are heavily used by the public and routinely subjected to beach racking (aka bull-dozed) . This makes it unlikely that the Recovery Plan can be implemented in these areas. Therefore, the beaches in the less populated areas of the west coast of the United States are the prime target for implementation of the Recovery Plan. Thousands of miles of coastline are threatened with closure or restricted human access in order to provide habitat for a bird that is very common.
