Protecting the western snowy plover is expensive. Results are tenuous and do not justify the cost.

ESTIMATED COST OF RECOVERY: $150,000,000 plus additional costs that cannot be estimated at this time.

DATE OF RECOVERY: Delisting could occur by 2047 if the recovery criteria above have been met.

The cost of this burden is public coastal access. Publicly owned beaches, military bases, and other government controlled coastlines are subject to closure. Private beaches, are not subject to the Snowy Plover Recovery Plan or closure to their owners.
